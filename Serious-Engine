git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/Serious-Engine
cd Serious-Engine/Sources
nano build-linux64.sh
#Comment 3 and 4 lines and add NCPU=5, like this

#NCPU=`cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep vendor_id |wc -l`
#let NCPU=$NCPU+2
NCPU=5

Also comment line 17 and add other cmake Release build, like this 

#cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. $1
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. $1

build engine with ./build-linux64.sh
cp cmake-build/ssam ../Bin
cp cmake-build/Debug/* ../Bin

Now copy all game data files to Serious-Engine 
I am using data from steam version game https://store.steampowered.com/app/41060/

Launch with ./Bin/ssam
